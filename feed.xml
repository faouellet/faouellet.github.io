To cap off this series, I wanted to talk about how I approached error management in DVCSUS. I already went into details for some parts (for instance, how I decided to deal with streaming errors). However, I didn’t offer a global reasoning to explain why I went the way I did. Exceptions Filesystem interactions If you look cl... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Of source control and databases - Annex A - Testing strategies</title><link href="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-tests/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Of source control and databases - Annex A - Testing strategies" /><published>2021-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-tests/</id> <content src="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-tests/" /> <author> <name>Félix-Antoine Ouellet</name> </author> <category term="Of source control and databases" /> <summary> All the code for the articles in this series can be found here. While programming something new is always fun, there comes a time when we have to put our invention to the test. Can the thing we created stand the test of reality? So far, you, the reader, had to blindly assume that what I was showing you was indeed working. In this article, I will demonstrate that your faith in me wasn’t mi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Of source control and databases - Part 5 - Remote support (ish)</title><link href="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-remote/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Of source control and databases - Part 5 - Remote support (ish)" /><published>2021-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-02-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-remote/</id> <content src="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-remote/" /> <author> <name>Félix-Antoine Ouellet</name> </author> <category term="Of source control and databases" /> <summary> All the code for the articles in this series can be found here. As with the previous article, we’ll now look at an extension to my original programming assignment. This time we’ll teach DVCSUS about remote repositories. Interface One of the cornerstones of distributed source control is the ability to interact with distant repositories. This is crucial because it enables teams to cooperat... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Of source control and databases - Part 4 - Branches support</title><link href="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-branch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Of source control and databases - Part 4 - Branches support" /><published>2021-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-branch/</id> <content src="https://faouellet.github.io//dvcs-branch/" /> <author> <name>Félix-Antoine Ouellet</name> </author> <category term="Of source control and databases" /> <summary> All the code for the articles in this series can be found here. For this article and the next, we’ll be looking at some functionalities that weren’t included in my original programming assignment. Up first is the adding branch support to DVCSUS. Interface Even if branches are a supplementary feature, their interface will be like all others: as simple as can be. To this end, I propose to ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
